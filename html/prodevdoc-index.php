			<h3>Whole Brain Balance</h3>
			<p>I like to play music to help counterbalance the logical and analytical parts of my brain. Sitting down at the piano or the guitar, and playing an old familiar tune, or improvising a bit, helps me to open up the creative part of my brain. After engaging the logical part of my brain for some time, I feel like the scope of my thinking can begin to narrow, and it's easy for me to get stuck in a loop of frustration, and seeing the solution to a problem can become difficult. Playing music allows me to open up the creative part of my brain, and helps to broaden my thinking, allowing for new perspectives on how to tackle a problem that my logical brain is struggling with.</p>
			<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
			<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
			<p>Hi, my name is Nick, and I help to restore, maintain and conserve our urban and natural environment, by using coding and GIS mapping to develop surveying tools so we can enjoy and utilize our public lands and urban infrastructure now and into the future. Do you work with any GIS or mapping technologies in your business?

			<h3>Direct/Indirect Marketing Initiatives</h3>
			<p>I approached some people I know who own a small furniture store in Rio Rancho about doing some work for them on their website. Their site could use an update and some work, and they want to add some functionality to it as well. We made a handhshake agreement that I could start doing some work for them when I'm done with the boot camp.</p>
			<p>I created a Twitter and LinkedIn account last week. I need to add more to my profiles, and especially take the time to work on my LinkedIn. As someone with no social media at all prior to this, I'm going to consider this a step into indirect marketing for myself.</p>

			<h3>Group Board Game Reflection</h3>
			<p>Overall, I thought that our team worked together playing Forbidden Island quite well. I'm sure that it helps that both Calder and myself had played the game a few times before, and also that we enjoy playing board games as a hobbies. We started off the game by reading over the directions (always read the documentation). Although Calder and I had played the game before we still needed a refresher, and we all knew that it would be good for us to go through it together.</p>
			<p>After playing the first couple of turns, I felt like everybody had a good grasp on how to play the game and what to do. Because Calder and I had the most experience, we took on more of a leadership role of directing and guiding our teammates. Everyone else in our group really rose to the occasion. I felt like Michael, Marcus and JJ all were able to utilize their roles to the best of their abilities. Although we didn't win, we got super close and managed to stay alive way longer than I thought we were going to be able to. We really had some strokes of bad luck at the onset of our game with the roles we were dealt and getting flood cards early on. If we had been able to switch out one of the movement based roles that we had for the engineer card, I think that we definitely would have been able to win.</p>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>Week 0</h3>
			<p>Well, I made it through week 0, only nine more to go. It was an intense experience, but more or less what I was prepared for. I had some trouble wrapping my head around the data design lectures and project at first. But after slamming my head into the problem for a while, re-reading through the Mastering MySQL chapter in the textbook, and consulting with some classmates about the material, I think I am finally starting to get it. I get the feeling that this aspect of the material may just not be my strong suit, but then again, maybe I just need some more practice with the practical implementation of the concepts for it to really come together for me.</p>
			<p>I am already beginning to feel more comfortable laying out and creating a document from scratch. It's becoming more natural for me to lay out and create the different basic elements and stylings for my sites from a blank page. This coming week I am going to try to keep in mind the law of diminishing returns regarding working on a problem. I should try to be more proactive about speaking with my classmates about issues I am having, and consulting with them to help problem solve sooner than I have been.</p>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>Week 1 is over, and on the whole I'm feeling a bit more confident about everything. Object oriented hit me like a truck, I was feeling pretty lost in the middle of the week. Now though, after the weekend, I feel pretty comfortable with the concepts we were learning this week. These concepts are fairly high level, and it's alot to take in in a short amount of time. At the end of the lectures, my brain felt fried and overloaded with information. After a few days though, the concepts started to sink in a little bit more. I think it just takes a while for my brain to actually parse all of the new information that I'm getting and make sense of it. It wasn't until Thursday or Friday of week 1 that I finally entirely grasped everything that we were doing at the end of week 0 with MySQL. I'm starting to see how all the layers are meshing together better now, and I definitely feel like I am making progress. But, it's definitely a two steps forward one step back situation.</p>
			<h3>Week 2</h3>
			<p>Week 2 went a bit more smoothly for me. I feel like I'm finally getting into the groove of things. We started doing CSS this week, and some more front end stuff, and that makes a little more sense to me off the bat than the back end development. I'm pretty sure that I want to specialize more in the front end development. I'm enjoying working on the CSS challenege assignment. For me, it's a fun puzzle, and I get a similar kind of enjoyment out of it as doing crossword puzzles.</p>
			<p>We also started on our Capstone projects this week. I would have been happy with any of the projects we voted on, but I am particularly excited about our group's project. We got the first draft for our Epic done on Friday, so I'm very pleased with that. I'm bracing myself though, for the what our capstone will bring in the future. I feel like we're in the honeymoon phase right now, and that stuff is going to ramp up very quickly.</p>
			<h3>Week 3</h3>
			<p>I feel like I got a lot accomplished this week. We went to 1 Million Cups on Wednesday, and later on that same evening I went to ABQ Web Geeks. I'm normally a pretty introverted person, so it can be uncomfortable for me to put myself out there and talk to strangers and actively go to a meetup with strangers like at Web Geeks or 1 Million Cups. That being said, when I just force myself to engage I'm always surprised that it's not that bad, and I tend to feel better for it. I just need to remember that when my natural feeling is to want to just go home, or do something else avoidant rather than do something that may help me further my coding education or career.</p>
			<p>I asked a question to the BudBoard people during the Q&A session of their presentation. I also talked with them for a a couple of minutes after the presentation, and got their card. Later on, at Web Geeks, I chatted with Mark who organizes the meetup, as well as with a couple of other people who were there. I mostly just listened in on their conversation, trying to learn what I could, but I felt like it was good to make an appearance, and at least make myself known a bit. I'm going to try to go again next month.</p>
			<p>I was a little bit disappointed about how our Capstone project was going this past week. We were already a little bit behind, but not too bad, but then after Rochelle reviewed our data design it ended up that we would need to narrow the scope of our project in order to be able to finish everything by the end of class. That's disappointing, but also good that we are dealing with it now rather than having something that we won't be able to finish by the end of the class. The way that we had to scale our project back changes the way that we want the app to work pretty drastically. But it is only going to be a prototype, so it's okay. We are going to be able to work on it more after the class, and expand it to more of our original intention for the app contest. But we finally got the last bit of our Epic done on Friday, and we got tickets assigned to start writing our classes, so at least we are able to being moving forward, even if it is about a week late.
