			<h3>Whole Brain Balance</h3>
			<p>I like to play music to help counterbalance the logical and analytical parts of my brain. Sitting down at the piano or the guitar, and playing an old familiar tune, or improvising a bit, helps me to open up the creative part of my brain. After engaging the logical part of my brain for some time, I feel like the scope of my thinking can begin to narrow, and it's easy for me to get stuck in a loop of frustration, and seeing the solution to a problem can become difficult. Playing music allows me to open up the creative part of my brain, and helps to broaden my thinking, allowing for new perspectives on how to tackle a problem that my logical brain is struggling with.</p>
			<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
			<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
			<p>Hi, my name is Nick, and I help to restore, maintain and conserve our urban and natural environment, by using coding and GIS mapping to develop surveying tools so we can enjoy and utilize our public lands and urban infrastructure now and into the future. Do you work with any GIS or mapping technologies in your business?

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>Week 0</h3>
			<p>Well, I made it through week 0, only nine more to go. It was an intense experience, but more or less what I was prepared for. I had some trouble wrapping my head around the data design lectures and project at first. But after slamming my head into the problem for a while, re-reading through the Mastering MySQL chapter in the textbook, and consulting with some classmates about the material, I think I am finally starting to get it. I get the feeling that this aspect of the material may just not be my strong suit, but then again, maybe I just need some more practice with the practical implementation of the concepts for it to really come together for me.</p>
			<p>I am already beginning to feel more comfortable laying out and creating a document from scratch. It's becoming more natural for me to lay out and create the different basic elements and stylings for my sites from a blank page. This coming week I am going to try to keep in mind the law of diminishing returns regarding working on a problem. I should try to be more proactive about speaking with my classmates about issues I am having, and consulting with them to help problem solve sooner than I have been.</p>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>Week 1 is over, and on the whole I'm feeling a bit more confident about everything. Object oriented hit me like a truck, I was feeling pretty lost in the middle of the week. Now though, after the weekend, I feel pretty comfortable with the concepts we were learning this week. These concepts are fairly high level, and it's alot to take in in a short amount of time. At the end of the lectures, my brain felt fried and overloaded with information. After a few days though, the concepts started to sink in a little bit more. I think it just takes a while for my brain to actually parse all of the new information that I'm getting and make sense of it. It wasn't until Thursday or Friday of week 1 that I finally entirely grasped everything that we were doing at the end of week 0 with MySQL. I'm starting to see how all the layers are meshing together better now, and I definitely feel like I am making progress. But, it's definitely a two steps forward one step back situation.</p>
